## Background

After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected me to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose me to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token thatâ€™s ERC-20 compliant. I launched a crowdsale that allows people moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
